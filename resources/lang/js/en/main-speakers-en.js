But things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try. "
