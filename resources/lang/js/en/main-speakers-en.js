But things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try. "

Experienced programmer regardless of the language ought to look at things from various standpoints outside the commonly used paradigm. This allows her to choose the proper strategy which fits the task, customer’s requirements, saves time and money. Having our product as an example, I’d like to show new language and new methods, which are not that frequently used in the mainstream. I believe this will broaden the horizon of the conference audience."
