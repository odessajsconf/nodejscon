Of course, you should write a clean code, but today it`s not enough - every day you need to communicate with clients, work with your team and find solutions. You can`t be efficient at work without all these skills, so you don`t have career growth. I`ll tell about how you can constantly improve yourself and what you should do to get extra result from your work. See you on May 17th!"
