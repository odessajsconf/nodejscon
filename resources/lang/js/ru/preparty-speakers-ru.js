Of course, you should write a clean code, but today it`s not enough - every day you need to communicate with clients, work with your team and find solutions. You can`t be efficient at work without all these skills, so you don`t have career growth. I`ll tell about how you can constantly improve yourself and what you should do to get extra result from your work. See you on May 17th!"

So what is a mentorship and how to be good at it? Often when we start mentor/mentee interaction we might notice that these "simple" soft skills are not so simple and not so soft. This talk will give you great insight on mentor\'s etiquette and how to gain most being a mentor. It also gives a great understanding of mentor-mentee relations to the mentee.</p>' +
