            '<p class="text-bold m-b-5">DESCRIPTION</p>' +
            '<p class="m-t-0">Learn how to build and train Neural Networks using the most popular Machine Learning framework for JavaScript, TensorFlow.js. </p>' +
            '<p class="m-t-0">This is a practical workshop where you\'ll learn "hands-on" by building several different applications from scratch using TensorFlow.js.</p>' +
            '<p class="m-t-0">By the end you\'ll know:</p>' +
            '<ul class="m-t-0">\n' +
            '  <li>The *essential* mathematics.</li>\n' +
            '  <li>What are Neural Networks?</li>\n' +
            '  <li>How to find and use pre-trained models from the internet.</li>\n' +
            '  <li>How to build and train a Neural Network to solve regression and classification tasks.</li>\n' +
            '  <li>aHow to build upon an existing Neural Network and perform Transfer Learning.</li>\n' +
            '</ul>' +
            '<p class="text-bold m-b-5">WHY YOU SHOULD COME TO THIS WORKSHOP</p>' +
            '<p class="m-t-0">People who developing modern client-side apps with JavaScript should know about distributed data structures like CRDT.</p>' +
            '<p class="text-bold m-b-5">SKILLS &amp; EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR THE WORKSHOP</p>' +
            '<p class="m-t-0">If you have ever been interested in Machine Learning, if you want to get a taste for what this exciting field has to offer, if you want to be able to talk to other Machine Learning/AI specialists in a language they understand, then this workshop is for you.</p>' +
            '<p class="text-bold m-b-5">TARGET AUDIENCE</p>' +
            '<p class="m-t-0">The ideal student for this workshop is someone with existing experience with JavaScript. You must have experience running commands on the command line. You are experienced running NodeJS scripts. You know how to  `npm install` a package.</p>'
